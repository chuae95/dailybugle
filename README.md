A Marvel Fan App that pulls information from Marvel's API that displays the full catalogue of heroes and comics available in their database.
This site was built using a combination of ReactJS and Firebase. ReactJS was used to create the framework for the site, while a database that stored user's shopping cart information was created as well. 
Axios was also used, in conjunction with async functions, to make the API calls and retrieve the relevant information before the page is loaded. 
Bootstrap and CSS was used to style the pages.

A home page has also been designed to provide users with a more engaging experience when using the site. 
To support sales, a Cart page has been created as well.
